# Start-Drive

# Application description
The application was created for driving schools to facilitate communication between students, instructors and people managing the driving school. Thanks to the application, instructors can plan dates and times of driving lessons, while students can choose free dates and times of lessons with the selected instructor.

# 1. Registration as a driving school

To register as a driving school, simply click the "register" button, then click "as a driving school", and then fill in the fields required for registration.

Driving school account description:

- Homepage

After logging in, you can see the home page and the menu and the last three questions asked by students and instructors.

- Instructors

After logging in as a driving school, the user can add instructors. After clicking on the icon of a given instructor, you can see their data and calendar. The calendar includes the option to add an instructor's absence, e.g. due to vacation or sick leave. You can also see the days when the driving school is closed. For each day when the driving school is open, the instructor's availability is also recorded, the inscription "free" means that the instructor has available hours in which to conduct training for the student, while the inscription "busy" means there are no free hours. Placing the cursor on the icon with the inscription "free" allows you to read the available hours. Clicking on the icon with a given day allows you to read the school's opening hours and the list of registered students for a given day, as well as add a student for a driving lesson. If the instructor is unable to conduct a driving lesson at a given time, you can add a free hour for them. It is also possible to edit and delete the student's data. Clicking on the icon with the words "generate code" will create a code needed to create an account for a given instructor.

- Students

It is also possible to add students. After adding a student and clicking on their icon, a list of driving lessons for which the student was registered is displayed, along with information about which instructor conducted the lesson and at what times. You can also see the total number of lesson hours the student has had, and below it the student's data, which can be edited along with the "generate code" option, which allows the student to create an account.

- Course rounds

In this tab, you can divide students into groups/tours that are trained at a specific time and plan which groups of students will be trained in the future. You can also create a group of students who, for example, are currently taking theoretical training (lectures before starting driving lessons) or practical training, thanks to which the driving school managers can check which students are taking a specific training. After clicking on the icon of a given student, a list of completed driving lessons is displayed, which allows you to quickly check the remaining lesson hours that the student must take in order to be able to take the state exam.

- Main calendar

Clicking on a specific date in the calendar allows you to obtain information on the planned driving lessons of all instructors. This allows you to quickly check the availability of an instructor, their free hours and sign up a student for a driving lesson with a given instructor at a specific time.

- Information for students/instructors

In this tab, the driving school managers can add information that is addressed only to instructors, only to students or to everyone. Thanks to this, both instructors and students can quickly see the information provided by the driving school after logging into their accounts.

- Forum

In the forum tab, you can ask and answer questions. This is possible for everyone: the driving school managers, instructors and students. Answers and questions are visible to everyone (driving school managers, instructors and students). It is also possible to find a specific question in the search engine.

- Settings

In this tab, you can set the opening hours of the driving school. It is also possible for the driving school to add individual days when the school will be closed, which can be seen by instructors and students after logging into their accounts. You can also set the minimum free time between two driving lessons. Time between rides, i.e. the minimum free time that must be between two driving lessons so that you can still add another driving lesson during that time. Thanks to this setting, the calendar next to instructors will show the word "busy" when all hours are busy, but there will be, for example, a 10-minute break in rides between lessons. For example, if we set the time between rides to 1 hour, then when the instructor has 50 minutes off between one ride and the next and all other hours are occupied, the instructor's calendar will show the word "occupied", because it is not worth it for a driving school to register a student with an instructor when they only have 50 minutes off between rides, because they should have at least 1 hour off between two rides to register another student in their place.

- Driving school information

In this tab, a user logged in as a driving school can add information about the company, e.g. achievements, exam pass statistics, etc.

- Edit/Delete driving school

Here you can edit the driving school details, change the password and delete the driving school profile.

# 2. Registering as an instructor

# Technologies:
- C#, .NET, Entity framework (backend),
- JWT (authorization)
- Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS (frontend)
- SQL Server (database)

# Starting:
To start the application you need to:
- start SQL Server

Starting the backend

- open the Start-Drive.API project, e.g. in Microsoft Visual Studio, fill in the fields in the appsettings.json file, for example like this:
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "StartDriveConnectionString": "server=EnterSQLServerNameHere;database=StartDriveDb;Trusted_Connection=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
  },
  "AuthSettings": {
    "securityKey": "provideSecurityKey",
    "validAudience": "http://localhost:4200",
    "validIssuer": "http://localhost:7149"
  }
- then open Package Manager Console and to create a database type the following commands:
- add-migration "initialMigration"
- update-database
- the database will be created.

The second way to create a database is to add ready files with the created database located in the SQLServerFiles folder with a ready database structure to SQL Server.

- then run the application by clicking the green triangle button in Visual Studio to run the application

Starting the frontend

- open the Start-Drive.UI project, e.g. in Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- open the terminal and go to the Start-Drive.UI folder
- in the terminal type npm install
- after installing, in the console type ng serve or npm start to start the application
